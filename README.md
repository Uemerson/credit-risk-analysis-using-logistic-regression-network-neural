# Description

Scientific work of the Special Topics in Machine Learning discipline of the Postgraduate Program in Computer Science (Master's Degree) at Universidade Estadual Paulista "Júlio de Mesquita Filho" - UNESP under the guidance of Prof. Dr. João Paulo Papa.
The main objective is to perform the bank credit risk classification using the Credit approval data set database, from the UCI repository. The classification was made through two well-known Machine Learning techniques, Logistic Regression and Artificial Neural Networks type MLP. Both models achieved good results, with the logistic regression model having an average accuracy of 86%, while the neural networks had an average accuracy of 83.7%.

# How to use?

The python scripts are in the Logistic Regression and Network Neural - MLP folder. You can run logistic_regression.py or credit_classification_nn.py using for example google colab.
